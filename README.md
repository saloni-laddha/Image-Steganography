# Image-Steganography
This comprises of 2 main modules-
1. Image-in-image steganography
2. Text-in-image steganography

The image/text files are first encrypted and placed in a hiding network on sender's side. They are decrypted and safely obtained from the reveal network on the receiver's side. Both networks are trained simultaneously and are independent of the input image data.
